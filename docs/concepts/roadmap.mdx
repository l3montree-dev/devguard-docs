# Roadmap

The initial development of FlawFix will be broken down into three milestones:

1. **Milestone #1: Alpha-Version**  
Implementing all functions absolutely necessary for the success of the alpha version of FlawFix

* Publication of the website and project-documentation (the improvement of both will be an ongoing process)

* User management (RBAC)

* Project and Organization management

* SCA scan and SBOM (CyclonDX) handling

* Asset-handling (grouping and adding additional information)

* APIs to gather relevant data for the CVSS 4.0 calculation and the necessary CVE information

* Risk identification

* Risk assesment

* Risk (remediation) prioritization

* User Interface

* Dashboards
 
2. **Milestone #2: Beta-Version**  
Necessary functions are enriched with additional functions that further simplify the use of FlawFix

* Implementing or improving functionalities based on the feedback of the Alpha version users/testers

* Improvement of the risk treatment process

* Handling of false positives

* Automated risk acceptance (elective feature - based on criteria chosen by the user)

* Integration of open-source scanners to simplify the configuration process


3. **Milestone #3: v.1.0 Release**  
Further improvement based on user/tester feedback

4. **Backlog:** Planned functions that may be integrated in the future

*More granular Tasks and Milestones can be seen in Tickets on the FlawFix GitHub Repository.*
